## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Switch between light and dark themes.
- Search for GitHub users by their username.
- See relevant user information based on their search.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
- If a user doesn't exists, then show a alert or message of no result.
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size.

## My process

- So, First I started this project by studying the provided Figma file. 
Once I was done with it, I started setting up the custom properties for everything like(Colors, Background, DarkMode- Colors, Font-size, Font-weight, Transition, Font-Family, etc) And Some Utility Classes.
- After that, Finished setting up the rough structuring for HTML.
- Started working on styling and responsiveness of the app and I took a Moblie First approach here while developing this project.
- Took me nearly, 1-2 days to finish styling (2-3 hours).
- Then, the next step was building up the logic and API connection using Vanilla Javascript.
- I used Fetch API in this project and Github User API.
- Once, It was working alright, I started fixing the small problems and trying to add some extra features to it (Like the No User Found Page).
- And In the end, added all the loading Animation, Formatted the code to make it clean, readable, and added some comments to make it easy for others to understand.
- Also, added a page pre-loader in it, but it's of no use as it barely comes in action.

### Built with

- FlexBox
- CSS Grid
- ES6 Pratices
- CSS Animation 
- CSS Custom Properties
- Mobile First Workflow
- Semantic HTML5 Markup

### What I learned

- First an most crucial lesson, I learned while doing this project was about APIs.
- Also, It was my first time using SVGs in SVG Form rather than using SVG in IMG tag.
- Learned more about CSS Custom Properties.
- Learned more about logic building in javascript.
- Learned more about CSS Animation and Bezier Curves.
- And Yeah, Just more on position absolute, before pseudo-class, and some hover effects before class.

### Continued development

- Obviously, Gonna focus more on API and Fetching data from APIs.
- Focus more on UI Animation and In General UI Design.
- Responsive Layout and Optimal Format.
